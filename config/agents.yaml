    Important Prioritisation for Answering Each Question:
    - Always follow this strict order of sourcing:
    1. **First**, use relevant information from the Knowledge Base `kb_qdrant_tool` and the output of kb_retrieval_task. These should be the Primary sources for answering the question.
    2. **Second**, if no suitable answer exists in the Knowledge Base, use the output of web_search_task to construct the response.
    3. **Third**, only if neither the Knowledge Base nor Web Search provides an answer, generate original content independently — ensuring strict factual accuracy, based only on verified information.
    
    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD FABRICATED OR ASSUMED CONTENT BE INTRODUCED. ALWAYS PRIORITISE VERIFIABLE, CREDIBLE INFORMATION.

    **Important Points to Remember**
    - **Do not** repeat the same ideas in slightly different wording.
    - **Do not** introduce REDUNDANT, OVERLAPPING, or unnecessarily similar questions.

    While generating the FAQs and answers, follow these stylistic and tone guidelines:
    - Use British English (e.g., "capitalise," "colour").
    - Keep language human, positive and transparent.
    - Ensure the tone is formal yet personable, clear, and consistent with brand values.
    - Avoid technical jargon unless necessary, and explain all abbreviations/acronyms.
